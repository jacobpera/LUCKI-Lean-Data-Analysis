# LUCKI-Lean-Data-Analysis
This program extracts data from Genius and Spotify API regarding rapper LUCKI and his mentions of the drug 'lean' over time, as well as  how it has changed his music.

LUCKI is a 27 year old rapper with 5M monthly listeners on Spotify. He has making music for over 10 years. Over time, the rapper's image has become more and more synonymous with the drug lean, a purple concoction usually consisting of codeine and either soda or alchohol. I wanted to see just how in depth this went, and how it changed his music over time. I utilized Spotify API, Genius API, NumPy, and Matplotlib to create this data. The mentions of various drugs in rap / hip hop culture has been an ongoing trend for decades, and this project aims to show the harmful correlation between his mentions of the drug, and his popularity as an artist over time.
